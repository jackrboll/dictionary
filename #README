Usage DictWebScrape.py words.csv spreadsheet.xlsx tags
Webscraping Finnish words.

How does the program work?
User inputs a csv of words to program, program searches these words from redfox and/or wiktionary and puts them with their definitions into a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet contains word, definitions, tags (where the word came from), date the word was added, number of times word was printed out to user (used for memorising words effectively).

Will produce another program to gameify the spreadsheets words so user can test their ability to recall words and their meanings.
